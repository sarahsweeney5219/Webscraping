# Webscraping
Here is a collection of projects I've done messing around with webscraping.
In automatetweeting.py I used webscraping to automate tweeting a user's given input on twitter.
In webscrape_TSLA_tweets.py I used webscraping to gather the data of the top tweets about $TSLA in a day and compile these results into a CSV called tsla_tweets.csv for further data analysis. I also used a similar proceedure to webscrape WSB data from Reddit. I then used an R script to create a wordcloud of the most commonly used words in the TSLA tweet data I gathered, as well as performed a sentiment analysis of these tweets. I included pictures of the resulting worldcloud and sentiment anaysis barchart.
