# Webscraping
Here is a collection of projects I've done messing around with webscraping.
In automatetweeting.py I used webscraping to automate tweeting a user's given input on twitter.
In webscrape_TSLA_tweets.py I used webscraping to gather the data of the top tweets about $TSLA in a day and compile these results into a CSV called tsla_tweets.csv for further data analysis.
